# CliLib
A library aiming to be an easy to use and simple argument parser for CLI applications.

A significant portion of the code is from a repository called [MiniCommander](https://github.com/MichaelGrupp/MiniCommander). Looking back it would have been appropriate to fork that repository but anyways, check it out if you are interested in it.
